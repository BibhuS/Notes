# 4.What is Machine Learning:
  - Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. While artificial intelligence (AI) is the broad science of mimicking human abilities, machine learning is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn.
  - The processes involved in machine learning are similar to that of data mining and predictive modeling. Both require searching through data to look for patterns and adjusting program actions accordingly.
  - Many people are familiar with machine learning from shopping on the internet and being served ads related to their purchase. This happens because recommendation engines use machine learning to personalize online ad delivery in almost real time.
  - Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.
  - Supervised Learning:
    - Supervised algorithms require a data scientist or data analyst with machine learning skills to provide both input and desired output, in addition to furnishing feedback about the accuracy of predictions during algorithm training.
    - Data scientists determine which variables, or features, the model should analyze and use to develop predictions.
    - Once training is complete, the algorithm will apply what was learned to new data.
  - Unsupervised Learning:
    - Unsupervised algorithms do not need to be trained with desired outcome data. Instead, they use an iterative approach called deep learning to review data and arrive at conclusions. 
    - Unsupervised learning algorithms -- also called neural networks -- are used for more complex processing tasks than supervised learning systems, including image recognition, speech-to-text and natural language generation.
    - These neural networks work by combing through millions of examples of training data and automatically identifying often subtle correlations between many variables. Once trained, the algorithm can use its bank of associations to interpret new data.
    - These algorithms have only become feasible in the age of big data, as they require massive amounts of training data.
##### 4.1 What is required to create a good machine learning systems:
 	- Data preparation capabilities.
	- Algorithms – basic and advanced.
	- Automation and iterative processes.
	- Scalability.
	- Ensemble modeling.
  
##### 4.2 Who's using it ?
	- Most industries working with large amounts of data have recognized the value of machine learning technology. By gleaning insights from this data – often in real time – organizations are able to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over competitors.
	- Financial services:
		- Banks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning technology for two key purposes:
			- to identify important insights in data, and prevent fraud.
			- The insights can identify investment opportunities, or help investors know when to trade.
			- Data mining can also identify clients with high-risk profiles, or use cybersurveillance to pinpoint warning signs of fraud.
	- Health care:
		- Machine learning is a fast-growing trend in the health care industry, thanks to the advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patient's health in real time. 
		- The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or red flags that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment. 
		
	- Retail:
		- Websites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine learning to analyze your buying history. 
		- Retailers rely on machine learning to capture data, analyze it and use it to personalize a shopping experience, implement a marketing campaign, price optimization, merchandise supply planning, and for customer insights. 
	
	- Oil and gas:
		- Finding new energy sources. 
		- Analyzing minerals in the ground. 
		- Predicting refinery sensor failure. 
		- Streamlining oil distribution to make it more efficient and cost-effective. 
		- The number of machine learning use cases for this industry is vast – and still expanding.
    
##### Did you know ?
	- In machine learning, a target is called a label. where in statistics, a target is called a dependent variable.
	- A variable in statistics is called a feature in machine learning.
	- A transformation in statistics is called feature creation in machine learning.
