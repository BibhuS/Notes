# About the Course:
  - Hi all, a warm Welcome to all of you. If you are one of the person who is seeking to explore more like others in Machine Learning area but dont know where/how to start ? Horray, you are in the right place at right time.
  - The course has been designed by a Professional Machine Learning Engineer, who is seeking more oppertunites by sharing his knowledge by helping you to solve Complex Algoritms using simple/complex usecases in simple way.
  - I am going to take you step by step to the wolrd of Machine Learning, With every tutorial in this course you will develop new skills and improve your understanding in Machine Learning.
  - Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises which are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models and usecases.
