# Regression Models

## 1. What is Regression Model ?
- In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables/factors.
- It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors').
	- Dependent variable: the main factor that youâ€™re trying to understand or predict.
	- Independent variables: the factors you suspect have an impact on your dependent variable.
- More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.
- Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning.
- Regression analysis is also used to understand which among the independent variables are related to the dependent variable, and to explore the forms of these relationships(trends).
- In restricted circumstances, regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables.
- Many techniques for carrying out regression analysis have been developed. Familiar methods such as "linear regression" and "ordinary least squares regression" are "parametric", in that the regression function is defined in terms of a finite number of unknown parameters that are estimated from the data.
- Nonparametric regression refers to techniques that allow the regression function to lie in a specified set of functions, which may be infinite-dimensional.

## 2. Why Regression Model ?
- As mentioned above, regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables. it helps us to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales between Dependent and Independent Variables(features) which give us a best model that will high accurate output

## 3. Types of Regression Models:
- There are several types of Regression models used in Machine Learning which falls under supervised learning
	- Simple Linear Regression
	- Multiple Linear Regression
	- Polynomial Regression
	- Super Vector Regression
	- Decision Tree Regression
	- Random Forest Regression
